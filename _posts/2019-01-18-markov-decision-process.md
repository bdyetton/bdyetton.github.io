# [WIP] Picking a career with Markov Decision Processes (MDP)

I'm currently taking an a Re-enforcement Learning class at UCI with the brilliant Emre Neftci.  
Our first lecture covered Markov Decision Processes, which are a model which helps assign value to a set states where 
only some state contain rewards, and there are different transition probabilities between each state.
Like most algorithms and models, writing a jargon filled description is not enlightening. 
So lets jump into an example to help motivate the idea!

## Academia or Industry?
This is the question I have been churning over in my head for the last 2 years. After finishing my PhD, do I take the 
long arduous route of becoming a tenured professor? Or jump into an "industry" position, i.e. working for a company.
Each has its pros and cons:
* Academia:
    - Flexible work: As a professor, you chose what to focus on. Want to study the convolutional neural network models 
    of perception? Go for it? The effects of music on the autonomic system? Hell yea! As long as you can get some funding for it 
    (which is not trival, but we'll ignore that for now), you can do it.
    - Flexible hours: My advisor works from home 3 days a week. Some professors are home by lunch. 
    Many professors do not even show up on a friday. Sounds great! However, with the ability to not work at specific times, comes 
    the pressure to work at all hours. To get ahead in this extremely competitive career, you have to publish, publish, publish, 
    and hence you need to work, work, work! So flexible hours is a mixed blessing.
    - Cash Money: Pay compared to the american national average is pretty dam good. The UC system releases salary information
    for all employees, including the professors. Most are making somewhere between $80k-$160k. Not bad. However, this is at a UC, and i
     imagine the pay is much less at other institutions. Couple this with the long hours, and the pay starts to loose its shine.
